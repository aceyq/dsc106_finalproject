      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This prototype explores how projected changes in global temperature and precipitation
        under different CMIP6 scenarios may shape future climate patterns and global vegetation.
        Users can compare emission pathways and regional outcomes using the controls below.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current version focuses on two core time series visualizations. Future iterations
        will add narrative annotations, maps, and explicit links to vegetation and biome changes.

      <h2>Project Write-Up</h2>

      <h3>1. What have you done so far?</h3>
      <p>
        So far, we have built the core structure of the Climate Futures Explorer prototype, including
        the user interface, dropdown controls, and two main D3 time-series visualizations. We have
        connected the charts to scenario and region selectors so that the user can dynamically
        explore differences in future climate projections. We also integrated processed temperature
        and precipitation datasets from the CMIP6 archive and ensured they load efficiently through
        JavaScript. Additionally, we created a cohesive design system with consistent styling,
        padded card components, and a dark background theme to increase readability and focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the visuals, we have outlined the narrative flow that the final project will follow,
        including how temperature trends, precipitation shifts, and ecological responses will be
        introduced in a step-by-step story. We set up the structure for adding future annotations
        and explanations to guide users toward important insights. Overall, the prototype now
        includes all foundational elements needed for the explorable explanation we plan to build.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have also begun experimenting with alternative visualization ideas, including preliminary 
        map mockups and concept sketches for a linked-view interface that connects spatial patterns to 
        the time-series trends already implemented. This early design exploration helps us evaluate which 
        visual forms best support the story we want to tell and where future improvements should be targeted. 
        In parallel, we organized our data-processing workflow so new CMIP6 variables or vegetation indicators 
        can be incorporated seamlessly later. By establishing a flexible codebase and clear visual direction 
        at this stage, we are preparing the foundation needed to scale the project into a richer explorable 
        explanation.
      </p>

      <h3>2. What will be the most challenging part of the project and why?</h3>
      <p>
        The most challenging part of the project will be designing an integrated narrative that
        smoothly connects the climate variables to ecological outcomes while keeping the interface
        intuitive and uncluttered. Climate data is inherently complex, and adding meaningful
        explanations without overwhelming users requires careful information design. Another major
        difficulty will be integrating spatial data, such as maps or vegetation classifications,
        into the existing time-series framework. Ensuring that the visual transitions feel coherent
        and that users understand how each chart relates to the evolving story will take significant
        iteration.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also anticipate challenges in balancing interactivity with interpretability. As we add
        more layers—scenarios, regions, biome indicators, and narrative steps—it becomes harder to
        maintain visual clarity and avoid cognitive overload. Developing a layout that supports
        multiple linked views while remaining visually clean will require thoughtful prototyping
        and user-first design decisions. Ultimately, the biggest challenge is not technical, but
        ensuring the final narrative remains compelling, accessible, and scientifically accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another possible challenge will be communicating uncertainty responsibly without overwhelming 
        users with technical details. CMIP6 models contain variability across institutions, scenarios, 
        and ensemble members, and presenting this uncertainty transparently, whether through error bands, 
        model spreads, or qualitative explanations, requires careful judgment. We want viewers to understand 
        both the robustness of long-term climate trends and the nuance in regional projections. Finding the 
        right level of detail and the right visual encodings to convey uncertainty will be essential to 
        maintaining scientific accuracy while still providing a smooth, engaging user experience.

        <h2>How Different Climate Futures Diverge</h2>
        <p class="scrolly-intro">
          Scroll through the story beats below. Each step highlights a different CMIP6 emissions
          pathway. As you move down the page, the visualizations on the right will focus on that
          scenario, while the region dropdown lets you see how the same pathway plays out in
          different parts of the world.

        <div class="step" data-scenario="ssp126">
          <h3>SSP1-2.6 – Rapid mitigation</h3>
          <p>
            In a world that aggressively cuts emissions, global temperature still rises,
            but the curve stays relatively shallow. Precipitation changes are present,
            yet less extreme, giving ecosystems more time to adapt before major biome
            shifts are locked in.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step" data-scenario="ssp245">
          <h3>SSP2-4.5 – “Middle-of-the-road” pathway</h3>
          <p>
            This pathway is close to our current trajectory. Warming accelerates after
            mid-century, and precipitation shifts become more noticeable—more intense
            rainfall in some regions and drying in others—raising pressure on crops,
            forests, and water systems.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step" data-scenario="ssp370">
          <h3>SSP3-7.0 – High emissions, uneven action</h3>
          <p>
            In this scenario, global cooperation stalls. Temperatures climb much more
            steeply, and rainfall patterns become more volatile. Some regions face
            repeated droughts while others see heavier downpours, increasing the risk
            of vegetation stress and biome disruption.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step" data-scenario="ssp585">
          <h3>SSP5-8.5 – Fossil-fuel intensive future</h3>
          <p>
            This fossil-fuel heavy world leads to the fastest warming and the largest
            shifts in precipitation. It represents a “worst-case” benchmark where
            ecosystems have the least time to adapt, and the likelihood of large-scale
            biome transitions is highest.
